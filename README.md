# Tweetoes | Rotten Tomatoes + Twitter

This was originally a final project for UCF's Rapid App course. The point was to integrate 2 APIs, so of course I chose Rotten Tomatoes and Twitter, aka social movies (hooray!).

Unfortunatley, this was before I understood the glory of version control and git. That said, let's bring this puppy up to speed.

Tweetoes away!
